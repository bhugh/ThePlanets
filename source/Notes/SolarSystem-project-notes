 TODO:

  X Add moon to solar system

  X Remove mode instructions as soon as any button is pressed
 X Mode instructions last less time
 X Mode isntructions disappear by time & not how many frames shown

  X Different figures drawn in planets, as well as colors, like Sat/Jup.  Maybe X on all the planetismals & asteroids, all planets are full in w/ color. Asteroids could be one notch smaller than planets @ min

    FILL IN EARTH MARS MERCURY - COLORED BRIGHTLY.  But maybe a pattern also, so visible on BW disp

  X Main view maybe should pause or something while Settings menu or anything else is showing
   
   X could adjust default time forward settings based on how slow the watch is showing new frames

    X Show only planets  option or other filters. Or go back to inner, middle, distant SS & omit other planets/asteroids.
     - m

   --> Widget would  just have the ecliptic screens,

   2 or 3 day - inner SS
