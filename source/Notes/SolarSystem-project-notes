NEW TODO 2025/01/13:
 - need to decide on GREEN or BLUE horizon line.  Right now both are working, memory out.

NEW TODO:

 - Screen doesn't refresh on BACK button
 - |STOP| short msg when back==stop
 - X Stop running after X calculations or seconds
 - X Update intro msgs to reflect new navigation
 - Stop showing intro msgs & big screen titles after X starts of the program
 - Keep horizon line if time step is by exactly 24 hr until it isn't
 - 1st button press doesn't do anything, even if the initial banners are gone
 - mode 3 & 4 ? doesn't show orbits for some reason (XX seems to happen only in sim??!?)
 - Add option to 'flip' view angle for SS up or down instead of just down
 - X Show more precise moon lit % 
 - Make moon lit % be more scientifically exact instead of approx.
 - Add option to manually input latitude & longitude



Remove:
 = Vivoactive, doesn't work at all (storage) Xed
 - Vivoactive HR works fine (slow of course)
- FR 230 - out of memory, no work Xed
  FR 235, same Xed
  Fenix 3, same Xed

  Fenix 5/quatrix works fine
  D2 Air X10 good

  FR 735, ..then entering menu crashed.  PLenty of memory so ??/??!? Xed

     -- planet dots & planets somehow not lined up with each other. They're just off FIXED!!!!!

Approach 20 - entering menu crashed

 - So FR 735, App 20 don't support Menu2 , Xed

 menu crashes bec. Menu2 is not avail on some early devices.  Set up so menu just imm exits for those devices & they are good (they just don't get any menu)

  FR930xt, immediate crash Xed

  Epix, does not have Math.floor, Xed
  FR235, not enough memory, fR230 same
  FR 630 same, 920XT
  D2 Bravo & titanium same
  fenix 3
  Vivoactive



 TODO:

  X Add moon to solar system

  X Remove mode instructions as soon as any button is pressed
 X Mode instructions last less time
 X Mode isntructions disappear by time & not how many frames shown

  X Different figures drawn in planets, as well as colors, like Sat/Jup.  Maybe X on all the planetismals & asteroids, all planets are full in w/ color. Asteroids could be one notch smaller than planets @ min

    FILL IN EARTH MARS MERCURY - COLORED BRIGHTLY.  But maybe a pattern also, so visible on BW disp

  X Main view maybe should pause or something while Settings menu or anything else is showing
   
   X could adjust default time forward settings based on how slow the watch is showing new frames

    X Show only planets  option or other filters. Or go back to inner, middle, distant SS & omit other planets/asteroids.
     - m

   --> Widget would  just have the ecliptic screens, 

--> Time frame on mode change generally should be 2-3-4 notches faster, real watch is much slower than simulator
  4yrs - far dist SS
  2 yrs - outer, or 6 months, 1 yr on faster watch
   2 or 3 day - inner SS
   other modes OK

   X Needs own LOGO

   X Page of HELP _ what are planet names & abbr
